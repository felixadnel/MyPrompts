Imagine you have a question, and the answer to that question can be either "true" or "false." A boolean expression is a statement or a combination of statements that can be evaluated to either true or false.

Boolean expressions are commonly used in programming and logic to make decisions and control the flow of a program. They involve the use of logical operators such as "and," "or," and "not" to combine different conditions.

Let's break it down with some examples:

Comparison Operators:
You can compare values using operators such as "equals" (==), "not equals" (!=), "greater than" (>), "less than" (<), "greater than or equal to" (>=), and "less than or equal to" (<=). For example, the expression "5 > 3" is a boolean expression that evaluates to true because 5 is indeed greater than 3.

Logical Operators:
Logical operators allow you to combine multiple boolean expressions. The three main logical operators are:

"AND" (&&): This operator returns true only if both the expressions on either side of it are true. For example, the expression "x > 3 && x < 10" is true if the value of variable x is greater than 3 AND less than 10.
"OR" (||): This operator returns true if at least one of the expressions on either side of it is true. For example, the expression "x == 3 || x == 5" is true if the value of variable x is equal to 3 OR equal to 5.
"NOT" (!): This operator negates the boolean value of an expression. For example, the expression "!x > 3" is true if the value of variable x is NOT greater than 3.
Boolean expressions can be used in various ways, such as conditional statements (if-else statements), loops, and decision-making in general. By evaluating boolean expressions, you can determine the outcome of a condition and control the program's behavior accordingly.
